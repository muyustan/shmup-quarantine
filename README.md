# shmup-quarantine
A little game I am developing during corona virus quarantine.
By the time of this writing, it is still on progress. However, you can download and run the versions pushed here.
Just download/clone the folder and run `main.py` by:

`python3 main.py`

Note that you should have `pygame` module installed on your system, if not, install with the following:

`python3 -m pip install pygame`
